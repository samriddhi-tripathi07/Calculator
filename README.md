# Basic Calculator

A simple calculator built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This project is designed to perform basic arithmetic operations and provide a user-friendly interface. This is my first ever project using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and I'm excited to share it with the community.

    *   Addition
    *   Subtraction
    *   Multiplication
    *   Division
*   User-friendly interface with on-screen buttons
*   Responsive design for various screen sizes

## Technologies Used
*   HTML: Structuring the calculator layout
*   CSS: Styling the calculator interface
*   JavaScript: Handling calculations and user interactions

1.  Clone the repository: `git clone https:                                                
2.  Open the index.html file in a web browser to use the calculator.

## Usage
1.  Enter numbers and operators using the on-screen buttons.
2.  View the calculation results on the display screen.

## Future Improvements
*   Advanced mathematical functions (e.g., trigonometry, logarithms)
